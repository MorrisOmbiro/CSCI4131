        <h1>About this service</h1>
        <p> 
        This service was created as the first application to use a new RPC mechanism designed in the Computer Laboratory - MSRPC2. It runs over MSNL (Multi-Service Network Layer) - a network layer protocol designed for ATM networks.
            <br><br>
            A video capture board in an Acorn Archimedes grabs one frame every second and the WWW server requests a frame from it using MSRPC2 (indirectly). Each frame is JPEG encoded by the Archimedes.
           <br><br>

The online coffee pot actually predates our World Wide Web server by some time. If you want to know how it all came about, take a look at its (non-technical) biography.

        <ul>
            <li>The lights in the Trojan Room aren't always switched on, but we try to leave a small lamp pointing at the coffee pot so you can see it at night.</li>            
            <li>Apart from the fares to get here, you need to be a member of the coffee club before partaking.</li>

        <h1>Local radio report</h1>
        <p>
           On 11th November 1994, we were visited by a reporter from our local 
            radio station, BBC Radio Cambridgeshire, to make a report on this service. Naturally we connected a radio to one of our workstations and relayed the 
            broadcast over our local network. The transmission was also recorded digitally, and now <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816022627/http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/coffee/report1994-11-11.au">you can hear it too</a> (1.5Mb, 3'20").

    We are grateful to BBC Radio Cambridgeshire for giving permission to put this audio file on the Web.
